				<p>Here is its description as interpreted by Wikipedia</p>
				<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandaberunda" title="Wikipedia">
					<p>
						The bird is generally depicted as clutching elephants in its talons and beaks, demonstrating its immense strength. In a coin(kasu) found in Madurai, it is shown holding a snake in its beak. All 2-dimensional depictions show a symmetrical image similar to the Double-headed eagle while other images show the long tail feathers resembling a peacock, which is the national bird of India. In the Chennakeshava temple of Belur, Karnataka, Gandaberunda (2-faced bird identified with Vishnu) is carved as a scene of "chain of destruction". A deer becomes prey to a big python, which in turn is lifted by an elephant. A lion attacks the elephant and the lion itself is devoured by Sharabha. Finally it is Gandabherunda which finishes off Sharabha.The Gandaberunda was a physical form displayed by Narasimha, Man-Lion incarnation of Vishnu.
