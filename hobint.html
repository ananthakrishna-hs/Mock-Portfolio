					Cricket is my oxygen. It is my hobby and my interest. Only bad thing that has happened is not turning it to profession. But thats life!

			<p>
				Generally, I don't take things too emotional. The only time I do, even in the remotest way possible is by watching a cricket match or a superb movie. Let's talk more.

					I learnt a lot from cricket, believe me!
				</p> 
				<p>
					I'm not like any other fan, you know criticise when your team loses or go mad when they win. But I am a human I feel those but I know the difficulties behind it, again believe me. By learning I mean values of life. Yes you heard it right, the sport can teach you values of life more than you can think of. I am not saying I have given up my dream of being a cricketer but making sure that I live <em>not survive</em> if something doesn't go in my way.
				</p>
				Anyway I do hope for a miracle rather a slightest chance, to try atleast.
				<p>
					What have I done with respect to cricket?

					Movies are of course for entertainment.
				</p>
				<p>
					People go for movies to get things out of their mind, so basically not think. But there are movies which make you think. I like those.
					I'm no one's fan. I watch them in an analytical way. The best thing which I have learnt from movies is that don't keep expectations, even in life.

					Here's what I have done with respect to movies.
